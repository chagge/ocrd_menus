## OCR'd menus

We have used `tesseract` as the OCR engine.

Further more we have divided the images to 

dark colored | light colored

Which allows us to tweak us the OCR algorithm accordingly and help it perform better

## To-do

- [ ] Train the tesseract engine for allowing better OCR performance
